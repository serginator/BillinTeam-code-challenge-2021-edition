# Billin code challenge 2021 edition

Welcome to the **Billin code challenge 2021 edition**. We look forward to to seeing what you come up with!!

Please find below the _instructions_ and the _key points_ for doing the exercise.

# Instructions

The challenge explanation is very simple, you have to develop an invoice importer. As such you'll find a test file called `importer.test.ts`. The goal is to get the tests running in green :). And that's all.

We have gien you with the two CSV files you will need to get the tests running in. Please see the `files` folder.

In the section **Tests** you will find the instructions to run the tests.

As you can see, the code files are in **Typescript**. If you never have programmed in this language, this is a great opportunity to start. Hey, remember that it is just Javascript.

Otherwise, you are free to approach the challenge in any way you wish. The only hint we will give you is that the code should be **extensible** and **maintainable**. We highly value code **readability**, so please pay close attention to this.

# Tests

- Single run testing
  `npm test`
- Development testing mode (watch all files or a single file)
  `npm run test:watch`
